            <p>What is Oyakodon? Oyakodon is a japanese dish composed of
                a rice bowl topped with a sweet and delicious egg/chicken mixture.
                The name <em>oyakodon</em> means parent (oya) and child (ko) bowl (don)
                in Japanese. While this may not sound particularly delicious, anyone
                who has tried oyakodon knows about the sweet and savoury flavour. The
                creamy egg topping mixed with tender chicken is irresistable and matches
                perfectly with Japanese white rice.
